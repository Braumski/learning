# CSS Web Layout

[A complete guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-basics-and-terminology)

Layouts are one of the most important components of designing a good webpage, making the page more readable and accessible.

## Flex box

A **one dimensional** layout system that can arrange items in a row or column, and can space the items to specifications. Flex box adds responsive elements to CSS.

Flexbox can overcome the limitations caused by containers such as block and inline because it does a better job of scaling over larger web pages and also provides more dynamic control* of the containers.

This is because it can grow, shrink and align the items inside it which give better control to the programmer over the contents and styling of the items inside the container.

Flex boxes are suited for *simple layouts* such as:

 - Search bar
 - Nav bar
 - Image gallery

## CSS Grid

A 2 dimensional layout system.

>[!note]
> There are no rules on which layout system to use between Flex and Grid, but in general, flexboxes are more suitable for dynamic elements in smaller spaces.
