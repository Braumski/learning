# Semantics and Meta Tags üîç

Semantic tags allow search engines and accessibility software to decipher the meaning of a tag, improving user experience and search engine optimization (SEO).

For example, it is common practice for developers to specify their links in the nav element as an unordered list

```html
<body>
    <header>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#home"></a></li>
                <li><a href="#about"></a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact"></a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
</body>
```

## Main content of a webpage: Articles and Sections

The 2 elements used in the main content of a webpage are _Article_ and _Section_ elements.

Articles indicate content that is

 - Complete
 - Self-contained
 - Independently distributable

Another way to think about articles is that there are many articles of separate stories on a newspaper page, each able to be cut out with scissors for use somewhere else. Examples of articles:

- Forum post
- Article
- Blog post
- User comment
- Interactive widget
