# Benefits and Drawbacks to React
## What is React?
React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by  Facebook.  The key advantage of React-based projects lies in their capability of changing data elements -- like news feeds or geolocations - **without reloading the entire page**. This makes apps faster and users happier.

## Benefits of react
### React component: Build once, use endlessly
_Value brought: fast project development_ React is based on components or isolated pieces of code to be reused within an app or across multiple projects. Each component contains all the logic for displaying a small portion of UI.  
  
Due to the high level of encapsulation, independent elements can be easily updated, plugged in, unplugged, and rearranged, leaving other modules unaffected. This approach simplifies and speeds up interface development.

### A lot of ready-made elements: Don’t reinvent the wheel

_Value brought: fast project development_  
  
React developers can create components by themselves or take advantage of available UI libraries with ready-made common elements: buttons, sidebars, icons, tables, and many more. The list of popular libraries includes but is not limited to

- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), using templates and themes of Bootstrap, the world’s most popular UI component library;
- [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/) particularly suitable for desktop applications;
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Material Kit React](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit-react/?partner=91096), and [React Toolbox](http://react-toolbox.io/#/), all inspired by Google’s [Material Design](https://material.io/design);
- [React Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) for B2B applications; and
- [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) for creating responsive web pages with human-friendly HTML.

The use of libraries dramatically accelerates the speed of development and is especially favorable for creating admin panels, running a proof of concept, and doing projects without designers.

### One-way data flow: Stick to one source of truth

_Value brought: high app performance, fewer bugs, easy-to-test code_  
  
In React applications, data flows only in one direction — top to bottom, from parent to child components. Data kept in a parent component is called _a state_ and determines what you see on the screen. The portion of the state transmitted to a child is called _a prop (property)_. Props are read-only values.  
  
Unidirectional flow used in React is also called “data down, actions up.” Let’s see how it works step by step.

_How data flows in a one-directional scenario._

1. A parent component passes a snapshot of the initial state (a prop) to  child components.  
  
2. A child component renders the UI based on the current prop value.  
  
3. A user reacts with an action (say, a click on the button or a name input).  
  
4. The user’s input doesn’t directly change the view. Instead, it triggers an update of the state in the parent component.  
  
5. The change in the state travels downward through a prop to a child component.  
  
6. The UI is re-rendered to reflect the current state.

A common real-life example of a React component is an online store's shopping cart. User actions — such as adding or deleting items — will first change the state of a high-level component. The information on updates will flow downwards via props and eventually leads to re-rendering of some UI elements like the list of chosen items and their total price.  
  
In large applications, high-level components have not a single child but rather a complex hierarchy of descendants nested within it. Yet, no matter the number of "relatives," the subordination is always the same: Child components can’t affect their siblings or parents. This produces a range of advantages including

- a single source of truth that makes it easier to trace where data goes wrong and fix bugs;
- more predictable changes; and
- low to zero risk of new bugs when adding features or scaling the app.

Ultimately, you’ve got better control over your data. In complex apps, this effect can be amplified by the state container called Redux, but we’ll talk about it in a later section describing tools to be used with React.

### React virtual DOM: Keep reloads to a minimum

_Value brought: high app performance, interactivity_  
  
A virtual DOM was introduced to make React-based apps really fast and interactive. To understand how this know-how works, let’s first get a sense of a real or browser DOM.  
  
Standing for a _document object model_, a DOM is a representation of a web page as a tree structure, generated by a browser.

JavaScript links to the DOM to manipulate the content and styles of the website. Alterations in the different parts of the tree trigger the relevant updates on the screen. This makes web pages _dynamic_ or responsive to user actions, such as mouse button clicks or key presses.  
  
On the dark side, even a minor tweak (say, you want to change a user’s age) entails the resource-intensive recalculation of the entire tree structure and repainting of all UI components. React addresses this problem with a [virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html), which is an in-memory snapshot of the real DOM.  
  
In fact, React uses simultaneously two virtual DOMs, generated just before and after the update. The so-called _diffing algorithm_ compares two copies against each other to spot differences. Only these differences are to be processed and updated in the real DOM — and consequently on the web page.
### React Hooks: Split the complex logic

_Value brought: enhanced code readability and testability, smaller app’s bundle size, logic reusability_  
  
To a great extent, React owes its popularity to reusable UI components. As we’ve said before, you can write a piece of UI once and then implement it again and again. But what if you are interested only in the logic (or behavior) behind the template?  
  
Before the 2019 and 16.8 release of the library, the React team offered no way to extract the stateful logic from one component to another. [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) were introduced as a solution to this problem. Now, when writing the code, developers can split the complex behavior into reusable pieces to be independently updated and shared across the app.  
  
Let’s explain this idea with an example. Say, you want to embed a date picker, a calendar that lets a user choose a single date, into your app. Obviously, somebody has already created this feature, so you just find a UI library that contains what you need and provides a few props to customize the design and functionality (color, size, highlighting of a current day, etc.)

## React drawbacks

Like with any popular technology, React receives not only praise but a lot of criticism as well. The most common complaints boil down to the following.

### Too many extra technologies

_‘‘I have to install 12 different packages and an external library to make React useful." (Reddit forum)_  
  
Though React per se is a lean, easy-to-learn library, you need to know and install tons of other things before starting to work with it. The only rule of thumb here is: Don’t include any new technology on top of React until a pressing need arises.  
  
One more problem is that some technologies can be poorly supported, getting no updates. Over time, such solutions become obsolete and noncompatible with newer versions of React. It’s critical to choose products from reliable providers if you aim at developing sustainable, long-run software — rather than at experimenting with different cool tools.

### Too much freedom

_“React opens up lots of possibilities to drown yourself in.” (Reddit forum)_  
  
React still doesn't provide a clear, unified roadmap for creating web apps. This gives you lots of freedom — but at a price.  
  
Due to a range of options and no strict instructions on how to arrange things, the success of your project will heavily rely on the experience of your developers in JavaScript, their ability to learn fast and grasp new concepts. For large-scale projects, it makes sense to hire a [software architect](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/software-architect-role/) to take care of the app structure, so you won’t end up with spaghetti code and poor UI.

### Overly verbose code

_“My main issue is with verbosity and general readability. Especially if the code is written by developers that are just starting to learn React." (Reddit forum)_  
  
This problem logically results from the previous one. With so many technologies and approaches available, and no rules dictated, the resulting code can be hard to understand for newcomers. So, it can take extra time to onboard new developers for a large React project.  
  
However, this issue can be solved by introducing comments, strict code styles and structure from the start. This, again, depends on the experience of your team.
